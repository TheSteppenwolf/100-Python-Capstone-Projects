# 100-Python-Capstone-Projects
This repository will have 100 different types of projects made on python.
The projects are organized within certain topics, in there you can find the name of the project and what it is about!

## Preliminar Note: 
The projects are being developing and will periodically be uploaded into the repository.

## Table of contents:
### Text:
#### Fizz Buzz:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For              numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

#### Reverse a string:
Enter a string and the program will reverse it.

#### Pig Latin:
Recreate Pig Latin which is a game of alterations played on the English language. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay)

#### Count Vowels:
Enter a string, the program will analyze the number of repetition of each vowels as well as the total vowels found.

#### Check if Palindrome:
Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

#### Get Atomic Time from Internet Clock:
This program will get the true atomic time from an atomic time clock on the Internet. Use any one of the atomic clocks returned by a simple Google search.
