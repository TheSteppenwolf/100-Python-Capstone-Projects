# Projects with numbers:
Here you will find all the projects related entirely to numbers.

## Find Pi to the Nth digit
Enter a number and have the program generate π (pi) up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Find Pi to the Nth digit](https://github.com/TheSteppenwolf/100-Python-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20PI%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit/Find%20PI%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit.ipynb)

## Find e to the Nth digit
Just like finding Pi to the Nth digit, but with e instead of π (pi). Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Find e to the Nth digit](https://github.com/TheSteppenwolf/100-Python-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20e%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit/Find-e-to-the-Nth-Digit.ipynb)

## Fibonacci sequence
Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
 
- Jupyer Notebook: [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/TheSteppenwolf/100-Python-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/Fibonacci%20Sequence/Fibonacci-Sequence.ipynb)

## Prime factorization
Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Prime factorization](https://github.com/TheSteppenwolf/100-Python-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/Prime%20Factorization/Prime%20Factorization.ipynb)

## Next Prime Number
Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Next Prime Number]()

## Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor
Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor]()

## Mortage Calculator
Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).

- Jupyter Notebook: [Mortage Calculator]()

## Change Return Program
The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Change Return Program]()

## Binary to Decimal and Back Converter
Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
