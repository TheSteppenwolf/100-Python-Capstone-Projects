# Projects with numbers:
Here you will find all the projects related entirely to numbers.

## Find Pi to the Nth digit
Enter a number and have the program generate π (pi) up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Find Pi to the Nth digit](https://github.com/TheSteppenwolf/100-Python-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20PI%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit/Find%20PI%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit.ipynb)

## Find e to the Nth digit
Just like finding Pi to the Nth digit, but with e instead of π (pi). Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- Jupyter Notebook: [Find e to the Nth digit](https://github.com/TheSteppenwolf/100-Python-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20e%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit/Find-e-to-the-Nth-Digit.ipynb)

## Fibonacci sequence
Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

## Prime factorization
Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
